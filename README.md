# MiningForCorr
Correlation analysis project with special emphasis to sparse canonical correlation analysis for applied to finance datasets. New users should start with the Mining for Corr Jupyter Notebook walkthrough.

Analyzer.py -- Analysis class for running different SCCA algorithms. Also contains helper functions for interpreting and visualizing results.

DataFetcher.py -- Intro class from the first stages of the project, where different methods for pulling and analyzing economic data were tested.

FinanceFetch -- Data extraction class for pulling earnings data from YahooFinance and stock data from stooq. Download stooq data from https://stooq.com/db/h/ and extract to your local directory to be able to run helper functions and related classes.

Mining for Corr - Notebook (.ipynb & html) where various experiments were run on the finance data in order to gain insights into the SCCA algorithm and motivate areas for further exploration with the finance information.
